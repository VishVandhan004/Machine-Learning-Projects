The above ML Model will predict your medical cost insurance based on the features like age, sex, BMI,smoker, region etc.
The code provided is for predicting insurance costs using linear regression. Here is an explanation of each line of code:

import numpy as np`: Imports the numpy library for numerical computations.
import pandas as pd`: Imports the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Imports the pyplot module from matplotlib for data visualization.
import seaborn as sns`: Imports the seaborn library for data visualization.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`: Imports the train_test_split function from scikit-learn, which is used to split the data into training and testing sets.
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression`: Imports the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn, which is used to perform linear regression.
from sklearn import metrics`: Imports the metrics module from scikit-learn, which is used to evaluate the performance of the model.
df = pd.read_csv('insurance.csv')`: Reads the insurance dataset from a CSV file and stores it in a pandas DataFrame called `df`.
df.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.
print(df.shape)`: Prints the shape of the DataFrame, which is the number of rows and columns.
df.info()`: Prints information about the DataFrame, including the number of non-null values in each column.
df.isnull().sum()`: Prints the number of missing values in each column of the DataFrame.
df.describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.
sns.set()`: Sets the default seaborn style for data visualization.
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))`: Creates a new figure with a size of 6x6 inches.
sns.distplot(df['age'])`: Plots a histogram of the 'age' column using seaborn.
plt.title("Age Distribution")`: Sets the title of the plot to "Age Distribution".
plt.show()`: Displays the plot.
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))`: Creates a new figure with a size of 6x6 inches.
sns.countplot(x="sex",data=df)`: Plots a countplot of the 'sex' column using seaborn.
plt.title("Sex Distribution")`: Sets the title of the plot to "Sex Distribution".
plt.show()`: Displays the plot.
df['sex'].value_counts()`: Counts the number of occurrences of each unique value in the 'sex' column.
sns.distplot(df['bmi'])`: Plots a histogram of the 'bmi' column using seaborn.
plt.show()`: Displays the plot.
df['region'].value_counts()`: Counts the number of occurrences of each unique value in the 'region' column.
df.replace({'sex':{'male':0,'female':1}},inplace=True)`: Replaces the values in the 'sex' column with 0 for 'male' and 1 for 'female'.
df.replace({'smoker':{'yes':0,'no':1}},inplace=True )`: Replaces the values in the 'smoker' column with 0 for 'yes' and 1 for 'no'.
df.replace({'region':{'southeast':0,'southwest':1,'northeast':2,'northwest':3}}, inplace=True)`: Replaces the values in the 'region' column with 0 for 'southeast', 1 for 'southwest', 2 for 'northeast', and 3 for 'northwest'.
X = df.drop(columns="charges",axis=1)`: Creates a new DataFrame `X` by dropping the 'charges' column from `df`.
y = df['charges']`: Creates a Series `y` containing the values from the 'charges' c.
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)`: Splits the data into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.
X_train.shape`: Returns the shape of the training set, which is the number of samples and features.
X_test.shape`: Returns the shape of the testing set, which is the number of samples and features.
reg = LinearRegression()`: Creates an instance of the LinearRegression class.
reg.fit(X_train,y_train)`: Trains the linear regression model on the training data.
training_data_prediction = reg.predict(X_train)`: Makes predictions on the training data using the trained model.
r2_train = metrics.r2_score(y_train, training_data_prediction)`: Calculates the R-squared score of the predictions on the training data.
test_data_prediction = reg.predict(X_test)`: Makes predictions on the testing data.
metrics.r2_score(y_test, test_data_prediction)`: Calculates the R-squared score of the predictions on the testing data.
sample_input_data = (30,1,22.7,0,1,0)`: Defines an input sample as a tuple of values.
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(sample_input_data)`: Converts the input sample to a numpy array.
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1,-1)`: Reshapes the input array to have a single sample and the same number of features as the training data.
prediction = reg.predict(input_data_reshaped)`: Makes a prediction on the input data using the trained model.
print("The insurance cost is ",prediction)`: Prints a message indicating the predicted insurance cost.

This code performs the following steps:
1. Reads the insurance dataset from a CSV file.
2. Displays information about the dataset, including its shape, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
3. Visualizes the distribution of the 'age', 'sex', and 'bmi' columns using seaborn.
4. Replaces the values in the 'sex', 'smoker', and 'region' columns with numerical values.
5. Splits the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
6. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
7. Creates a linear regression model and trains it on the training data.
8. Evaluates the performance of the model on the training and testing data.
9. Uses the trained model to make a prediction on a new input sample and prints the predicted insurance cost.

The code assumes that the insurance dataset is stored in a file named 'insurance.csv' and that the columns are in the same order as the input sample.
