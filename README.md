# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my machine learning projects. Each project is located in its own directory and includes the source code, data sets, and a detailed explanation of the project.

## Installation and Setup

Each project has its own specific installation and setup instructions located in its directory. Generally, you will need to have Python and several machine learning libraries installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
